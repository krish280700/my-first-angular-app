# Angular - Landing Page

This project involves creating a dynamic and visually appealing landing page for a Software as a Service (SaaS) tool. The landing page will be developed using Angular, a robust framework for building responsive and high-performance web applications.

# Version

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Lessons Learned

Learning Angular from scratch has been rewarding, teaching me the power of its component-based architecture, two-way data binding, and tools like the CLI for efficient development. I gained skills in routing, forms, RxJS for asynchronous data, and performance optimizations like lazy loading. Testing with Angularâ€™s tools underscored the importance of reliable, maintainable code, making it easier to build dynamic, scalable applications.
